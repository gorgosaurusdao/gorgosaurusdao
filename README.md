## What is GorgosaurusDAO?
I'm Brian, I want to buy a dinosaur, and I'm not really sure how to get the money or what to do with it after I have it, but I know I want to figure it all out. There's [a dinosaur that's up for auction](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/05/1109937791/dinosaur-skeleton-auction-nyc) on July 28, and I need to raise enough money AND figure out a cause for it to support.

## Why a DAO?
Seems like the right way to distribute stewardship across supporters.
