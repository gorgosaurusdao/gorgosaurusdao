# GorgosaurusDAO

## What is GorgosaurusDAO?
I'm Brian, I want to buy a dinosaur and then create an event space in New York that's oriented around the dinosaur, which can be a [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) for a community of artists, thinkers and builders. I'm not really sure how to get the money, but I know I want to figure it all out. There's [a dinosaur that's up for auction](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/05/1109937791/dinosaur-skeleton-auction-nyc) on July 28, and I need to raise enough money to buy it, a big area to house it, and then fixing up that building to be a proper community hub.

## Why a DAO?
Seems like the right way to distribute stewardship across supporters.

### How DAO?
We are going to use [nation.io](nation.io), which is built on top of Solana, and where we have technical experts who can help us navigate it.

## Progress 
- 7/7: I have confirmed my registration to the auction as paddle number 1! ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/LJMANY0.jpg)
